		<h1>The Summit student union</h1>

		<p>
		We are a student run union working to address the issues at <a href="https://www.summitlearning.org/">Summit</a> for both students and teachers. Our goal is to create change to better the lives within the Summit community.
		</p>

		<h1>The issues we want to address:</h1>

		<ul>
			<li>Lack of mental health help for students.</li>
			<li>Lack of support for teachers.</li>
			<li>Lack of student representation in board meetings.</li>
			<li>Lack of summit board transparency.</li>
			<li>Lack of student privacy</li>
		</ul>
                
		<h2> Lack of mental health help</h2>


		<h2> Lack of support for teachers </h2>

		<h2>Lack of student representation in board meetings</h2>
			
		The board meeting are held at <!-- TODO, be more exact -->  times that make it hard for students to attend.

		<h2>Lack of summit board transparency</h2>
		
		<h2>Lack of student privacy</h2>

		The school install the invasive monitoring software "Go Guardian" on all the school issued computers, however for poorer students these are often the only available computes.

		The software has access to the location of the device, the entire browsing history and all entered keystrokes. It is constantly sending data to a third party company, witch the keeps detailed logs and preforms data mining. 

		<h1>How to help</h1>
