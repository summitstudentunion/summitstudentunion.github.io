<h1>Overview</h1>
This document contains information about:
<ul>
    <li>The issues within the Summit system</li>
    <li>What we are doing to take action</li>
    <li>When to attend the Zoom meeting for action</li>
</ul>

<em>Be mindful about who you share this info with, whether you are willing to help or not. This is a serious goal to test whether Summit will listen and change for the better- we do not want to get shut down. </em>

Goal and Mission
<ul>
<li>Compile a list of demands for the benefit of students and teachers</li>
<li>Put pressure on the Summit school board and Diane Tavenner (Summit Founder) to implement institutional changes that would better the entire Summit system</li>
<li>Host physical acts of protection that disrupt the routine with the majority of the Summit Denali population (to emphasize dissatisfaction) </li>
</ul>

<li>Incorporate into a setlist of demands for Summit Board</li>

</ul>

<h2>Issues Of Urgency:</h2>
<ul>

<li>
Student representation within board and union meetings
<ul><li>Most board meetings are during the morning/afternoon, making it very difficult for students to attend</li>
<li>Request time change or attend a meeting during class in protest </li>
<li>Taking student and teacher feedback into account </li>
<li>working with the community to fix the issues at hand</li>
<li>Direct communication between summit schools/students and board</li></ul></li>

<li>
Mental health help accessibility to students
<ul>
<li>More full-time mental health counselors. Be able to accommodate all students if necessary</li>
<li>Easy access and awareness of accessibility to a counselor session </li>
<li>Teaching about coping mechanisms</li>
<li>Address when a fight or traumatic event happens with restorative justice</li>
<li>Designate safe spaces for those experiencing mental health issues that require a calm and private space</li></ul>
</li>

<li>Teacher Support
<ul>
<li>Compensation for extra hours worked </li>
<li>Higher pay</li>
<li>Mental health counselors for teachers </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Transparency from the Summit board<ul>
<li>Summit social media pages and website are not in line with what students are experiencing </li>
<li>Either change how school is functioning, or change the website info to be more accurate to experiences </li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

We will discuss these ideas further and work with everyone to change, add, or delete.

<h3>What are the pain points for the local students?</h3> portiz@sccoe.org or 408.401.4368- Peter ortiz:

<ul>
<li>as a student, I am unable to have a stable learning environment with different substitute teachers every class</li>

<li>My son had a new-to-Summit teacher last year who could not accommodate his IEP and could not quite make the jump from traditional education to the summit model. It was horrible for him, and he decided not to continue that language the following year.</li>

<li>I have no sense of security or stability</li>
</ul>
